Streams vs collections
======================
Collections are used to store and group the data in a particular data structure like List, Set or Map. 
But, streams are used to perform complex data processing operations like filtering, matching, mapping etc on stored data such as arrays, 
collections or I/O resources. That means, collections are mainly about data and streams are mainly about operations on data.

Collections Streams
==============================================================================
1. Can add/modify/delete elements anytime                  can not modify data in stream.
2. Data can access any order. i.e list.get(5);             elements can access only sequencially
3. Eagerly constructed                                     3. lazy constructed
4. Can traverse through any number of times                4. Stream can traverse only one time
