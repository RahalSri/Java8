Problem with annonymous classes
===============================
Lot's of boilerplate codes. Functional interaces reduce those boiler plate codes.

Functional Interfaces rules
======================
1. Interface which have just one abstract method
2. annotate with @FunctionalInterface

** A functional interface can have methods of Object class.
** Can have default methods (including static) https://howtodoinjava.com/java8/default-methods-in-java-8/

Examples
====================
Runnable & comparator

Where  can be used
===================
1. Lambda expression


* Lambda is a annonymous function

Usage
========
- Used to implement Functional interfaces (SAM)
  i.e : Runnable, Comparator
